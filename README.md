# SMLVinDecoder
Enter a Vin and it gives you all the information about the vehicle

It uses nhtsa.dot.gov to look up vehicles after you enter the VIN
I used the code provided for the request, but wrote the dataframe part and input myself

I am working on it to make it where it just displays the relavant information
I also want it to do it in a popout window and look good
Relavant infomration: Year, Make, Model, MSRP, gas/diesel
